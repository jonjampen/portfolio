<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    During my computer science supplementary subject, an important part of my final year of the
    Matura, we had the task to complete a project of our choice. I decided to create an online
    version of my favorite card game, so that I would be able to play it with my friends even if we
    are not at the same location. As we I have just learned SvelteKit during the past months, I
    decided to use that framework to get more comfortable and fluent using it. As the game has to
    update in real time (without the browser having to refresh), I chose the firebase realtime
    database as a storage for the game data. I chose to use firebase authentication.

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>
    Building this project deepened my comprehension of SvelteKit. I also learned a lot about
    firebase and the realtime database itself.

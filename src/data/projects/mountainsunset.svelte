<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Customizing my coding environment has always been important to me. Therefore, I decided to
    create my own theme for my favorite code editor: Visual Studio Code. "Mountain Sunset" is a dark
    Visual Studio Code theme based on the colors orange and blue. As of mid 2023 it has over 200
    installs.

## Description
Fatigue Diary is a web app for people suffering from chronic fatigue (ME/CFS, MS, Long COVID, ...). Fatigue patients often keep track of their energy level on a paper chart to plan their day and schedule enough rest time. The goal of this project was to find out whether I can create a web app that makes it more comfortable to use than the chart on paper. My web app allows users to enter their energy level after every activity and to display different charts showing the energy level throughout the day, week, month, or year. Additionally, the web app rates the activities based on their impact on the energy level which is calculated using all the user‚Äôs entered data from the past month. The web app was tested by about 15 therapists who were referred to me by my therapist and about as many patients who found my web app on social media. The few feedbacks I received from therapists and patients, as well as my own experience show that the web app offers a more efficient and practical way of tracking one‚Äôs energy. 

## Technologies
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend. For the backend I used PHP and a MySQL database.

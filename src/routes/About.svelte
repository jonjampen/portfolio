        <p>
            Hey, I'm Jon (<i class="ipa">/ j'É’n /</i>), an 18-year-old programming enthusiast. I
            caught the coding bug at age 12, and it's been an exciting journey ever since. Web
            development has become my passion, and with my recent completion of the matura, I'm all
            set to explore computer science in-depth. This website showcases my projects and
            provides a way to connect.
            <br />
            <br />
            Happy coding!

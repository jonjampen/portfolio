        <p>
            Hey, I'm Jon, an 18-year-old programming enthusiast. I caught the coding bug at age 12,
            and it's been an exciting journey ever since. Web development has become my passion, and
            with my recent completion of the matura, I'm all set to explore computer science
            in-depth. This website showcases my
            <a href="/projects" style="color: var(--white)">projects</a>
            and provides a way to <a href="#contact" style="color: var(--white)">connect</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Happy coding!
